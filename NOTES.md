##Notes so far:

* Passing initial state to client using embeded json
* Component "re-rendering" it self using embeded inital state
* After initial "re-rendering" embeded initial state is not used anymore
* Stores are hydrated client-side using store name
* Separate route-store that`s connected to react-router

##Todos:

* Less verbose way to identify and hydrate stores, today this is done using an separate key file..
* Is a method to getInitialState without doing a get agains the store?
* Clean up project stucture.
* Handle hydrates when back btn clicked
* Hydrating page2 store when changing route client-side
