##Notes so far:

* Passing initial state to client using embeded json
* Component "re-rendering" it self using embeded inital state
* After initial "re-rendering" embeded initial state is not used anymore
* Stores are hydrated client-side using store name
* Separate route-store thats connected to react-router

##Todos:

* Less verbose way to identify and hydrate stores.
* Is a method to getInitialState without doing a get agains the store?
* Improve how routing is handled.
* Clean up project stucture.
* Fix how page two is working. Right now server is rendering pageone for page2 route...
